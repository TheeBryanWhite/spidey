# Galactus #

This is an in-progress skeleton intended to replace Spidey. Spidey relies on a tried-and-tested Grunt task process but the industry is moving away from Grunt to Gulp (and in some cases, just foregoing the entire process and using NPM scripts).

p.s. Galactus eats planets. Gulp. Get it?
